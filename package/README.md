This package hosts functions that help with carrying out the necessary steps in the validation process in order to obtain the precision, recall and f1 scores involved in assessing the performance of a machine learning model.

# Installation Instructions
No installation possible from public domains like Anaconda or PyPi. Instead for local installation, using an anaconda or general command prompt, navigate to where the package is stored on your local drive. Once you are in the root directory where the setup.py file is located, simply run 'python setup.py install', which will create a distribution in the root directory. Before use, make sure to install the requirements.txt. file by 'pip install -r requirements.txt'. Alternatively, clone from Github using 'git clone 'url''.
